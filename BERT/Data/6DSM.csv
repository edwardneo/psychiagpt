specifiers common individuals multiple specific phobias,0
average individual specific phobia fears three objects situations approximately 75 individuals specific phobia fear one situation object,0
cases multiple specific phobia diagnoses diagnostic code reflecting phobic stimulus would need given,0
example individual fears thunderstorms flying two diagnoses would given specific phobia natural environment specific phobia situational,0
diagnostic features key feature disorder fear anxiety circumscribed presence particular situation object criterion may termed phobic stimulus,0
cat­ egories feared situations objects provided specifiers,0
many individuals fear objects situations one category phobic stimulus,0
diagnosis specific phobia response must differ normal transient fears commonly occur pop­ ulation,0
meet criteria diagnosis fear anxiety must intense severe ie marked criterion,0
amount fear experienced may vary proximity feared object situation may occur anticipation actual presence object situation,0
also fear anxiety may take form full limited symptom panic at­ tack ie expected panic attack,0
another characteristic specific phobias fear anxi­ ety evoked nearly every time individual comes contact phobic stimulus criterion b,0
thus individual becomes anxious occasionally upon con­ fronted situation object eg becomes anxious flying one every five airplane flights would diagnosed specific phobia,0
fear anxiety often expressed dif­ ferently children adults,0
also fear anxiety occurs soon phobic ob­ ject situation encountered ie immediately rather delayed,0
individual actively avoids situation either unable decides avoid situation object evokes intense fear anxiety criterion c,0
therefore longer experience fear anxiety daily life,0
fear anxiety proportion actual danger object situation poses intense deemed necessary criterion,0
although individuals specific phobia often recognize reactions disproportionate tend overesti­ mate danger feared situations thus judgment propor­ tion made clinician,0
individuals sociocultural context also taken account,0
example fears dark may reasonable context ongoing violence fear insects may disproportionate settings insects consumed diet,0
fear anxiety avoidance persistent typically lasting 6 months criterion e helps distinguish disorder transient fears common population particularly among children,0

females frequently affected males rate approximately 21 although rates vary across different phobic stimuli,0
animal natural environment situational spe­ cific phobias predominantly experienced females whereas bloodinjectioninjury phobia experienced nearly equally genders,0
however many individuals specific phobia unable recall specific reason onset phobias,0

specific phobia diagnosed children two issues considered,0
first young children may express fear anxiety crying tantrums freezing clinging,0
second young children typically able understand concept avoidance,0
therefore clinician assemble additional information parents teachers others know child well,0
excessive fears quite common young children usually transitory mildly impairing thus considered devel­ opmentally appropriate,0
cases diagnosis specific phobia would made,0
diagnosis specific phobia considered child important assess degree impairment duration fear anxiety avoidance whether typical childs particular developmental stage,0
although prevalence specific phobia lower older populations remains one commonly experienced disorders late life,0
several issues con­ sidered diagnosing specific phobia older populations,0
first older individuals may likely endorse natural environment specific phobias well phobias falling,0
second specific phobia like anxiety disorders tends cooccur medical concerns older individuals including coronary heart disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,0
third older individuals may likely attribute symptoms anxiety medical conditions,0
fourth older individuals may likely manifest anxiety atypical manner eg involving symptoms anxiety depression thus likely warrant diagnosis unspecified anxiety disorder,0
addition­ ally presence specific phobia older adults associated decreased quality life may serve risk factor major neurocognitive disorder,0
although specific phobias develop childhood adolescence possible specific phobia develop age often result experiences traumatic,0
example phobias choking almost always follow nearchoking event age,0
risk prognostic factors temperamental,0
temperamental risk factors specific phobia negative affec tivity neuroticism behavioral inhibition risk factors anxiety disorders well,0
environmental risk factors specific phobias parental over­ protectiveness parental loss separation physical sexual abuse tend pre­ dict anxiety disorders well,0

may genetic susceptibility certain category specific phobia eg individual firstdegree relative specific phobia an­ imals significantly likely specific phobia category phobia,0
individuals bloodinjectioninjury phobia show unique propensity vasovagal syncope fainting presence phobic stimulus,0
culturerelated diagnostic issues united states asians latinos report significantly lower rates specific phobia nonlatino whites african americans native americans,0
addition lower prevalence rates specific phobia countries outside united states par­ ticularly asian african countries show differing phobia content age onset gender ratios,0
suicide risk individuals specific phobia 60 likely make suicide attempt individuals without diagnosis,0
however likely elevated rates primarily due comorbidity personality disorders anxiety disorders,0
older adults impairment may seen caregiving duties volunteer activities,0
also fear falling older adults lead reduced mobility reduced physical social functioning may lead receiving formal informal home support,0
distress impairment caused specific phobias tend increase number feared objects situations,0
thus individual fears four ob­ jects situations likely impairment occupational social roles lower quality life individual fears one object situation,0
individuals bloodinjectioninjury specific phobia often reluctant obtain med­ ical care even medical concern present,0
additionally fear vomiting chok­ ing may substantially reduce dietary intake,0
situational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia clinical pre­ sentation given overlap feared situations eg flying enclosed places elevators,0
individual fears one agoraphobia situations specific phobia situa­ tional may diagnosed,0
two agoraphobic situations feared diagnosis agoraphobia likely warranted,0

irritable angry mood must characteristic child present day nearly every day noticeable others childs environment criterion,1
clinical presentation disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must carefully distinguished presentations related conditions particularly pediatric bi­ polar disorder,1
latter decades 20th century contention researchers severe nonepisodic irritability manifestation pediatric mania coincided up­ surge rates clinicians assigned diagnosis bipolar disorder pediatric patients,1
sharp increase rates appears attributable clinicians com­ bining least two clinical presentations single category,1
classic epi­ sodic presentations mania nonepisodic presentations severe irritability labeled bipolar disorder children,1
dsm5 term bipolar disorder explicitly reserved episodic presentations bipolar symptoms,1
prevalence disruptive mood dysregulation disorder common among children presenting pedi­ atric mental health clinics,1

risk prognostic factors temperamental,1
children chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psy­ chiatric histories,1
