A n x ie ty diSOrdGrS include disorders that share features of excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Fear is the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat, whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat. Obviously, these 
two states overlap, but they also differ, with fear more often associated with surges of autonomic arousal necessary for fight or flight, thoughts of immediate danger, and escape 
behaviors, and anxiety more often associated with muscle tension and vigilance in preparation for future danger and cautious or avoidant behaviors. Sometimes the level of fear 
or anxiety is reduced by pervasive avoidance behaviors. Panic attacks feature prominently 
within the anxiety disorders as a particular type of fear response. Panic attacks are not limited to anxiety disorders but rather can be seen in other mental disorders as well.
The anxiety disorders differ from one another in the types of objects or situations that 
induce fear, anxiety, or avoidance behavior, and the associated cognitive ideation. Thus, 
while the anxiety disorders tend to be highly comorbid with each other, they can be differentiated by close examination of the types of situations that are feared or avoided and 
the content of the associated thoughts or beliefs.
Anxiety disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods. They differ from transient fear or anxiety, often stress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically lasting 6 months 
or more), although the criterion for duration is intended as a general guide with allowance 
for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of shorter duration in children (as in separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism). Since individuals with anxiety disorders 
typically overestimate the danger in situations they fear or avoid, the primary determination of whether the fear or anxiety is excessive or out of proportion is made by the clinician, 
taking cultural contextual factors into account. Many of the anxiety disorders develop in 
childhood and tend to persist if not treated. Most occur more frequently in females than in 
males (approximately 2:1 ratio). Each anxiety disorder is diagnosed only when the symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance/medication or to another 
medical condition or are not better explained by another mental disorder.
eneralized Anxiety Disorder
Diagnostic Criteria 300.02 (F41.1)
A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than
not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school
performance).
B. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.
C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the
past 6 months);
Note: Only one item is required in children.
1. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge.
2. Being easily fatigued.
3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.
4. Irritability.
5. Muscle tension.
6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying
sleep).
D. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).
F. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or
worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder,
reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety
disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).
Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of generalized anxiety disorder is excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) about a number of events or activities. The intensity, duration, or 
frequency of the anxiety and worry is out of proportion to the actual likelihood or impact 
of the anticipated event. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry and to keep 
worrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to tasks at hand. Adults with generalized anxiety disorder often worry about everyday, routine life circumstances, such as 
possible job responsibilities, health and finances, the health of family members, misfortune to their children, or minor matters (e.g., doing household chores or being late for appointments). Children with generalized anxiety disorder tend to worry excessively about 
their competence or the quality of their performance. During the course of the disorder, 
the focus of worry may shift from one concern to another.
Several features distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from nonpathological anxiety. 
First, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are excessive and typically interfere significantly with psychosocial functioning, whereas the worries of everyday life 
are not excessive and are perceived as more manageable and may be put off when more 
pressing matters arise. Second, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are
more pervasive, pronounced, and distressing; have longer duration; and frequently occur 
without précipitants. The greater the range of life circumstances about which a person 
worries (e.g., finances, children's safety, job performance), the more likely his or her symptoms are to meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. Third, everyday worries are much 
less likely to be accompanied by physical symptoms (e.g., restlessness or feeling keyed up 
or on edge). Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report subjective distress due 
to constant worry and related impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas 
of functioning.
The anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following additional 
symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty 
concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and disturbed sleep, although only one additional symptom is required in children

B ip o ls r S n d rG lâ ted disorders are separated from the depressive disorders in 
DSM-5 and placed between the chapters on schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic 
disorders and depressive disorders in recognition of their place as a bridge between the 
two diagnostic classes in terms of symptomatology, family history, and genetics. The diagnoses included in this chapter are bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic 
disorder, substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder, bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition, other specified bipolar and related disorder, and unspecified bipolar and related disorder.
The bipolar I disorder criteria represent the modern understanding of the classic 
manic-depressive disorder or affective psychosis described in the nineteenth century, differing from that classic description only to the extent that neither psychosis nor the lifetime 
experience of a major depressive episode is a requirement. However, the vast majority of 
individuals whose symptoms meet the criteria for a fully syndromal manic episode also 
experience major depressive episodes during the course of their lives.
Bipolar II disorder, requiring the lifetime experience of at least one episode of major depression and at least one hypomanie episode, is no longer thought to be a "milder" condition 
than bipolar I disorder, largely because of the amount of time individuals with this condition spend in depression and because the instability of mood experienced by individuals 
with bipolar II disorder is typically accompanied by serious impairment in work and social 
functioning
Bipolar I Disorder
Diagnostic Criteria
For a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet tlie following criteria for a manic
episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes.
Manic Episode
A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood
and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at
least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or
more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:
1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external
stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or
psychomotor agitation (i.e., puφoseless non-goal-directed activity).
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or
foolish business investments).
C. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or
occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.
D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug
of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.
Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the
physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and,
therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis
Hypomanie Episode
A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood
and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or
more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant
degree:
1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external
stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or
psychomotor agitation.
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or
foolish business investments).
C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.
D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.
E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the
episode is, by definition, manic.
F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug
of abuse, a medication, other treatment).
Note: A full hypomanie episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,
medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond
the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanie episode
diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken
as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanie episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis.
Note: Criteria A-'F constitute a hypomanie episode. Hypomanie episodes are common in
bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder
The essential feature of a manic episode is a distinct period during which there is an abnormally, persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased 
activity or energy that is present for most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of at 
least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary), accompanied by at least three 
additional symptoms from Criterion B. If the mood is irritable rather than elevated or expansive, at least four Criterion B symptoms must be present.
Mood in a manic episode is often described as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or 
"feeling on top of the world." In some cases, the mood is of such a highly infectious quality 
that it is easily recognized as excessive and may be characterized by unlimited and haphazard enthusiasm for interpersonal, sexual, or occupational interactions. For example, 
the individual may spontaneously start extensive conversations with strangers in public. 
Often the predominant mood is irritable rather than elevated, particularly when the individual's wishes are denied or if the individual has been using substances. Rapid shifts in 
mood over brief periods of time may occur and are referred to as lability (i.e., the alterna-
tion among euphoria, dysphoria, and irritability). In children, happiness, silliness and 
"goofiness" are normal in the context of special occasions; however, if these symptoms are 
recurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmental level of the child, they may meet Criterion A. If the happiness is unusual for a child (i.e., 
distinct from baseline), and the mood change occurs at the same time as symptoms that 
meet Criterion B for mania, diagnostic certainty is increased; however, the mood change 
must be accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that are obvious 
to those who know the child well.
During the manic episode, the individual may engage in multiple overlapping new 
projects. The projects are often initiated with little knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems 
out of the individual's reach. The increased activity levels may manifest at unusual hours of 
the day.
Inflated self-esteem is typically present, ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked 
grandiosity, and may reach delusional proportions (Criterion Bl). Despite lack of any particular experience or talent, the individual may embark on complex tasks such as writing a novel 
or seeing publicity for some impractical invention. Grandiose delusions (e.g., of having a 
special relationship to a famous person) are common. In children, overestimation of abilities 
and belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal; 
however, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child attempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the 
child's normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied.
One of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2) and is 
distinct from insomnia in which the individual wants to sleep or feels the need to sleep but 
is unable. The individual may sleep httle, if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than 
usual, feeling rested and full of energy. When the sleep disturbance is severe, the individual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel tired. Often a decreased need for sleep heralds the onset of a manic episode

D eprG SSiV G diSO rdG rS include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, major 
depressive disorder (including major depressive episode), persistent depressive disorder 
(dysthymia), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder, depressive disorder due to another medical condition, other specified depressive disorder, and imspecified depressive disorder. Unlike in DSM-IV, this chapter 
"Depressive Disorders" has been separated from the previous chapter "Bipolar and Related Disorders." The common feature of all of these disorders is the presence of sad, 
empty, or irritable mood, accompanied by somatic and cognitive changes that significantly affect the individual's capacity to function. What differs among them are issues of 
duration, timing, or presumed etiology.
In order to address concerns about the potential for the overdiagnosis of and treatment 
for bipolar disorder in children, a new diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, 
referring to the presentation of children with persistent irritability and frequent episodes 
of extreme behavioral dyscontrol, is added to the depressive disorders for children up to 
12 years of age. Its placement in this chapter reflects the finding that children with this 
symptom pattern typically develop unipolar depressive disorders or anxiety disorders, 
rather than bipolar disorders, as they mature into adolescence and adulthood.
Major depressive disorder represents the classic condition in this group of disorders. It 
is characterized by discrete episodes of at least 2 weeks' duration (although most episodes 
last considerably longer) involving clear-cut changes in affect, cognition, and neurovegetative functions and inter-episode remissions. A diagnosis based on a single episode is 
possible, although the disorder is a recurrent one in the majority of cases. Careful consideration is given to the delineation of normal sadness and grief from a major depressive episode. Bereavement may induce great suffering, but it does not typically induce an episode 
of major depressive disorder. When they do occur together, the depressive symptoms and 
functional impairment tend to be more severe and the prognosis is worse compared with 
bereavement that is not accompanied by major depressive disorder. Bereavement-related 
depression tends to occur in persons with other vulnerabilities to depressive disorders, 
and recovery may be facilitated by antidepressant treatment

Major Depressive Disorder
Diagnostic Criteria
A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week
period and represent a change from previous functioning: at least one of the symptoms
is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.
Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.
1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g.,
appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the
day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than
5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.
(Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not
merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.
Diagnostic Features
The criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly every day to 
be considered present, with the exception of weight change and suicidal ideation. Depressed mood must be present for most of the day, in addition to being present nearly every day. Often insomnia or fatigue is the presenting complaint, and failure to probe for 
accompanying depressive symptoms will result in underdiagnosis. Sadness may be denied at first but may be elicited through interview or inferred from facial expression and 
demeanor. With individuals who focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should determine whether the distress from that complaint is associated with specific depressive 
symptoms. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt.
The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 weeks during 
w^hich there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities (Criterion A). In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad. 
The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list 
that includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased energy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To 
count toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must 
have clearly worsened compared with the person's pre-episode status. The symptoms 
must persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder 
episodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort.
The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person as depressed, 
sad, hopeless, discouraged, or "down in the dumps" (Criterion Al). In some cases, sadness 
may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out 
that the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals who complain 
of feeling "blah," having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood 
can be inferred from the person's facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals emphasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of 
sadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a 
tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated 
sense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky 
mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated.
Loss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some degree. Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, "not caring anymore," or not feeling any 
enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family 
members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a formerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to 
practice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire.
Appetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some depressed individuals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave 
specific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in 
either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure 
to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3).
Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping excessively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle insonrmia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or 
terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with oversleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased 
daytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the disturbed sleep.
Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., 
slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; 
speech that is decreased in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness) 
(Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe enough to be observable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings.
Decreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). A person may report sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to require
substantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For 
example, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are exhausting and take twice as long as usual.
The sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may include unrealistic negative evaluations of one's worth or guilty preoccupations or ruminations over minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral 
or trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense 
of responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delusional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally responsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet 
occupational or inteφersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very common 
and, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion.
Many individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make even minor 
decisions (Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory difficulties. Those engaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function. In 
children, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In elderly individuals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs 
of a dementia (''pseudodementia"). When the major depressive episode is successfully 
treated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particularly elderly persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presentation of an irreversible dementia.
Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common. 
They may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others 
would be better off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of committing suicide, to a specific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put 
their affairs in order (e.g., updated wills, settled debts), acquired needed materials (e.g., a 
rope or a gun), and chosen a location and time to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for 
suicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles, 
an intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emotional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to 
others. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminished 
suicide risk than denial of further plans for suicide.
The evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult 
when they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition (e.g., cancer, 
stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, pregnancy). Some of the criterion signs and symptoms of a major depressive episode are identical to those of general medical conditions 
(e.g., weight loss with untreated diabetes; fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in pregnancy; insonmia later in pregnancy or the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a 
major depressive diagnosis except when they are clearly and fully attributable to a general 
medical condition. Nonvegetative symptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthlessness, impaired concentration or indecision, and suicidal thoughts should be assessed with 
particular care in such cases. Definitions of major depressive episodes that have been modified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms appear to identify nearly the same individuals as do the full criteria

O bSG SSiV G -C O m p u lsiV G and related disorders include obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hairpulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due 
to another medical condition, and other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder and unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., body-focused repetitive behavior disorder, obsessional jealousy).
OCD is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions
are recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive 
and unwanted, whereas compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must 
be applied rigidly. Some other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are also characterized by preoccupations and by repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the 
preoccupations. Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are characterized primarily by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., hair pulling, skin picking) and 
repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviors.
The inclusion of a chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in DSM-5 reflects the increasing evidence of these disorders' relatedness to one another in terms of a 
range of diagnostic validators as well as the clinical utility of grouping these disorders in 
the same chapter. Clinicians are encouraged to screen for these conditions in individuals 
who present with one of them and be aware of overlaps between these conditions. At the 
same time, there are important differences in diagnostic validators and treatment approaches across these disorders. Moreover, there are close relationships between the anxiety disorders and some of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (e.g., OCD), 
which is reflected in the sequence of DSM-5 chapters, with obsessive-compulsive and related disorders following anxiety disorders.
The obsessive-compulsive and related disorders differ from developmentally normative preoccupations and rituals by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally 
appropriate periods. The distinction between the presence of subclinical symptoms and a 
clinical disorder requires assessment of a number of factors, including the individual's 
level of distress and impairment in functioning.
The chapter begins with OCD. It then covers b
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
-------------------- i-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diagnostic Criteria 300.3 (F42)
A. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both:
Obsessions are defined by (1) and (2):
1. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some
time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals
cause marked anxiety or distress.
2. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to
neutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e., by performing a compulsion).
Compulsions are defined by (1) and (2):
1. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g.,
praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.
2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or distress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or
mental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive.
Note: Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these behaviors or
mental acts.
B. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour per
day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning.
C. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects
of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
D. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder
(e.g., excessive worries, as in generalized anxiety disorder; preoccupation with appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania [hair-pulling disorder];
skin picking, as in excoriation [skin-picking] disorder; stereotypies, as in stereotypic
movement disorder; ritualized eating behavior, as in eating disorders; preoccupation
with substances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictive disorders; preoccupation with having an illness, as in illness anxiety disorder; sexual urges or fantasies,
as in paraphilic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders; guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder; thought insertion or delusional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; or
repetitive patterns of behavior, as in autism spectrum disorder).
The characteristic symptoms of OCD are the presence of obsessions and compulsions (Criterion A). Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images 
(e.g., of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone). Importantly, obsessions 
are not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary: they are intrusive and unwanted and 
cause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. The individual attempts to ignore or 
suppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding triggers or using thought suppression) or to neutralize them with another thought or action (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions
(or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting, 
repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an 
obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD 
have both obsessions and compulsions. Compulsions are typically performed in response 
to an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contamination leading to washing rituals or that something is incorrect leading to repeating rituals until it feels "just right")· The aim is to reduce 
the distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). However, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g., 
arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive 
(e.g., showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some 
individuals experience relief from anxiety or distress.
Criterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e.g.,
