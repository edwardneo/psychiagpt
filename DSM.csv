specifiers common individuals multiple specific phobias,1
average individual specific phobia fears three objects situations approximately 75 individuals specific phobia fear one situation object,1
cases multiple specific phobia diagnoses diagnostic code reflecting phobic stimulus would need given,1
example individual fears thunderstorms flying two diagnoses would given specific phobia natural environment specific phobia situational,1
diagnostic features key feature disorder fear anxiety circumscribed presence particular situation object criterion may termed phobic stimulus,1
cat­ egories feared situations objects provided specifiers,1
many individuals fear objects situations one category phobic stimulus,1
diagnosis specific phobia response must differ normal transient fears commonly occur pop­ ulation,1
meet criteria diagnosis fear anxiety must intense severe ie marked criterion,1
amount fear experienced may vary proximity feared object situation may occur anticipation actual presence object situation,1
also fear anxiety may take form full limited symptom panic at­ tack ie expected panic attack,1
another characteristic specific phobias fear anxi­ ety evoked nearly every time individual comes contact phobic stimulus criterion b,1
thus individual becomes anxious occasionally upon con­ fronted situation object eg becomes anxious flying one every five airplane flights would diagnosed specific phobia,1
however degree fear anxiety expressed may vary anticipatory anxiety full panic attack across different occasions encountering phobic object situation various contextual factors presence others duration exposure threatening elements turbulence flight individuals fear flying,1
fear anxiety often expressed dif­ ferently children adults,1
also fear anxiety occurs soon phobic ob­ ject situation encountered ie immediately rather delayed,1
individual actively avoids situation either unable decides avoid situation object evokes intense fear anxiety criterion c,1
active avoidance means individual intentionally behaves ways designed prevent minimize contact phobic objects situations eg takes tunnels instead bridges daily commute work fear heights avoids entering dark room fear spi­ ders avoids accepting job locale phobic stimulus common,1
avoid ance behaviors often obvious eg individual fears blood refusing go doctor sometimes less obvious eg individual fears snakes refusing look pictures ihat resemble form shape snakes,1
many individuals specific phobias suffered many years changed living circumstances ways designed avoid phobic object situation much possible eg indi­ vidual diagnosed specific phobia animal moves reside area devoid particular feared animal,1
therefore longer experience fear anxiety daily life,1
instances avoidance behaviors ongoing refusal engage activities would involve exposure phobic object situation eg repeated refusal ac­ cept offers workrelated travel fear flying may helpful confirming diagnosis absence overt anxiety panic,1
fear anxiety proportion actual danger object situation poses intense deemed necessary criterion,1
although individuals specific phobia often recognize reactions disproportionate tend overesti­ mate danger feared situations thus judgment propor­ tion made clinician,1
individuals sociocultural context also taken account,1
example fears dark may reasonable context ongoing violence fear insects may disproportionate settings insects consumed diet,1
fear anxiety avoidance persistent typically lasting 6 months criterion e helps distinguish disorder transient fears common population particularly among children,1
however duration criterion used general guide allowance degree flexibility,1
specific phobia must cause clinically significant distress impairment social oc­ cupational important areas functioning order disorder diag­ nosed criterion f,1
associated features supporting diagnosis individuals specific phobia typically experience increase physiological arousal anticipation exposure phobic object situation,1
however physi­ ological response feared situation object varies,1
whereas individuals situa­ tional natural environment animal specific phobias likely show sympathetic nervous system arousal individuals bloodinjectioninjury specific phobia often demonstrate vasovagal fainting nearfainting response marked initial brief acceleration heart rate elevation blood pressure followed deceleration heart rate drop blood pressure,1
current neural systems models specific phobia emphasize amygdala related structures much anxiety disorders,1
prevaience united states 12month community prevalence estimate specific phobia approximately 79,1
prevalence rates european countries largely similar united states eg 6 rates generally lower asian african latin american countries 24,1
prevalence rates approximately 5 children approximately 16 13 17yearolds,1
prevalence rates lower older individ­ uals 35 possibly reflecting diminishing severity subclinical levels,1
females frequently affected males rate approximately 21 although rates vary across different phobic stimuli,1
animal natural environment situational spe­ cific phobias predominantly experienced females whereas bloodinjectioninjury phobia experienced nearly equally genders,1
development course specific phobia sometimes develops following traumatic event eg attacked animal stuck elevator observation others going traumatic event eg watching someone drown unexpected panic attack feared situation eg unexpected panic attack subway informational transmission eg ex­ tensive media coverage plane crash,1
however many individuals specific phobia unable recall specific reason onset phobias,1
specific phobia usu­ ally develops early childhood majority cases developing prior age 10 years,1
median age onset 7 11 years mean 10 years,1
situational specific phobias tend later age onset natural environment an­ imal bloodinjectioninjury specific phobias,1
specific phobias develop child­ hood adolescence likely wax wane period,1
however phobias persist adulthood unlikely remit majority individuals,1
specific phobia diagnosed children two issues considered,1
first young children may express fear anxiety crying tantrums freezing clinging,1
second young children typically able understand concept avoidance,1
therefore clinician assemble additional information parents teachers others know child well,1
excessive fears quite common young children usually transitory mildly impairing thus considered devel­ opmentally appropriate,1
cases diagnosis specific phobia would made,1
diagnosis specific phobia considered child important assess degree impairment duration fear anxiety avoidance whether typical childs particular developmental stage,1
although prevalence specific phobia lower older populations remains one commonly experienced disorders late life,1
several issues con­ sidered diagnosing specific phobia older populations,1
first older individuals may likely endorse natural environment specific phobias well phobias falling,1
second specific phobia like anxiety disorders tends cooccur medical concerns older individuals including coronary heart disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,1
third older individuals may likely attribute symptoms anxiety medical conditions,1
fourth older individuals may likely manifest anxiety atypical manner eg involving symptoms anxiety depression thus likely warrant diagnosis unspecified anxiety disorder,1
addition­ ally presence specific phobia older adults associated decreased quality life may serve risk factor major neurocognitive disorder,1
although specific phobias develop childhood adolescence possible specific phobia develop age often result experiences traumatic,1
example phobias choking almost always follow nearchoking event age,1
risk prognostic factors temperamental,1
temperamental risk factors specific phobia negative affec tivity neuroticism behavioral inhibition risk factors anxiety disorders well,1
environmental,1
environmental risk factors specific phobias parental over­ protectiveness parental loss separation physical sexual abuse tend pre­ dict anxiety disorders well,1
noted earlier negative traumatic encounters feared object situation sometimes always precede development specific phobia,1
genetic physiological,1
may genetic susceptibility certain category specific phobia eg individual firstdegree relative specific phobia an­ imals significantly likely specific phobia category phobia,1
individuals bloodinjectioninjury phobia show unique propensity vasovagal syncope fainting presence phobic stimulus,1
culturerelated diagnostic issues united states asians latinos report significantly lower rates specific phobia nonlatino whites african americans native americans,1
addition lower prevalence rates specific phobia countries outside united states par­ ticularly asian african countries show differing phobia content age onset gender ratios,1
suicide risk individuals specific phobia 60 likely make suicide attempt individuals without diagnosis,1
however likely elevated rates primarily due comorbidity personality disorders anxiety disorders,1
functional consequences specific phobia individuals specific phobia show similar patterns impairment psychosocial functioning decreased quality life individuals anxiety disorders alcohol substance use disorders including impairments occupational inter­ personal functioning,1
older adults impairment may seen caregiving duties volunteer activities,1
also fear falling older adults lead reduced mobility reduced physical social functioning may lead receiving formal informal home support,1
distress impairment caused specific phobias tend increase number feared objects situations,1
thus individual fears four ob­ jects situations likely impairment occupational social roles lower quality life individual fears one object situation,1
individuals bloodinjectioninjury specific phobia often reluctant obtain med­ ical care even medical concern present,1
additionally fear vomiting chok­ ing may substantially reduce dietary intake,1
differential diagnosis agoraphobia,1
situational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia clinical pre­ sentation given overlap feared situations eg flying enclosed places elevators,1
individual fears one agoraphobia situations specific phobia situa­ tional may diagnosed,1
two agoraphobic situations feared diagnosis agoraphobia likely warranted,1
example individual fears airplanes ele­ vators overlap public transportation agoraphobic situation fear agoraphobic situations would diagnosed specific phobia situa­ tional whereas individual fears airplanes elevators crowds overlap two agoraphobic situations using public transportation standing line crowd would diagnosed agoraphobia,1
criterion b agoraphobia situations feared avoided thoughts escape might difficult help might available event developing paniclike symptoms inca­ pacitating embarrassing symptoms also useful differentiating agoraphobia specific phobia,1
situations feared reasons fear harmed directly object situations eg fear plane crashing fear an­ imal biting specific phobia diagnosis may appropriate,1
social anxiety disorder,1
situations feared negative evaluation so­ cial anxiety disorder diagnosed instead specific phobia,1
separation anxiety disorder,1
situations feared separation primary caregiver attachment figure separation anxiety disorder diagnosed instead specific phobia,1
panic disorder,1
individuals specific phobia may experience panic attacks con­ fronted feared situation object,1
diagnosis specific phobia would given panic attacks occurred response specific object situation whereas di­ agnosis panic disorder would given individual also experienced panic attacks unexpected ie response specific phobia object situation,1
obsessivecompulsive disorder,1
individuals primary fear anxiety ob­ ject situation result obsessions eg fear blood due obsessive thoughts contamination bloodborne pathogens ie hiv fear driving due obsessive im­ ages harming others diagnostic criteria obsessivecompulsive disorder met obsessivecompulsive disorder diagnosed,1
trauma stressorrelated disorders,1

eating disorders,1
diagnosis specific phobia given avoidance behavior exclusively limited avoidance food foodrelated cues case diagnosis anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa considered,1
schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorders,1
fear avoidance due delusional thinking schizophrenia schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorders diagnosis specific phobia warranted,1
comorbidity specific phobia rarely seen medicalclinical settings absence psycho­ pathology frequently seen nonmedical mental health settings,1
